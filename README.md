# N5-AUV
Here are some codes to program N5 Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). The system use Arduino as a slave, connected directly to thrusters, depth sensors, LCD, and servos. Meanwhile Raspberry Pi as a master, sending commands to Arduino and process all the hard tasks.

"all_in_one.ino" is a main Arduino code, meanwhile the .cpp and .h are the libraries that should be included. File .py are several codes with different scenarios to run the AUV.
